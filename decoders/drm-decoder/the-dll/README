IMPORTANT NOTE
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the plugin - in its current version - requires libfaad_drm-2.dll
to be installed in the ...\SDRplay\SDRuno folder

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The drm plugin for SDRuno is - as the name suggests - a plugin for 
decoding drm signals, as they are transmitted on shortwave.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DRM, Digital Radio Mondiale, is a form of digital radio. Transmissions
are relatively scarce here in Western Europe, but is seems that elsewhere
there is an increasing interest.

For DRM signals there are different Modes and Spectra, here is Western
Europe transmissions can be received in Mode B, with a spectrum of 10 KHz.
Other spectra are 4.5, 5, 9, 18 and 20 KHz.

Different Modes have different measures against fading in the signal.

The picture shows  a reasonable signal on 9760 KHz, a transmission of the
Radio Rumenia International, in Mode B, with a spectrum of 10 KHz.
The waterfall clearly shows the effect of fading on the signal,
the signal can be decoded however.

The picture shows that the receiver is tuned to 9760 KHz, that
the samplerate is already reduced to 62.5 KHz (the decoder will do the
further filtering an reduction to 12 KHz). 

The DRM plugin is an EXPERIMENTAL decoder,
developed for the SDRuno framework: it will attempt
to decode DRM transmissions. It is able to recognize Modes A, B and C
and will handle spectra up to 10 KHz.

The decoder is derived from - and technically equivalent to - the drm decoder for the swradio-8 software.

There are no controls on the widget, as soon as the plugin is activated
it will start reading in samples and trying to decode DRM.

A DRM signal is in one of 4 modes, Mode B is the one being decoded here.
The spectrum is "3", telling that the qwidth is 19 KHz, symmetrically
around 0.

The different labels in the
widget give information on the reception.
The name of the receiver service is "SNR Tiganesti E1".

On the right hand side of the widget, there are four labels, 
since the transmission can be decoder they are all green.
From top to bottom

   * the time sync label. DRM is transmitted using an (C)OFDM technique, what is important is that there is a time synchronization so that the receiver "knows"
where segments in the incoming sample stream start;

   * the FAC label. A DRM transmission contains data in the so-called FAC, i.e. Fast Access Channel. The FAC data is encoded as 4QAM, which is relatively easy
to decode (given that the time synchronizaarion is OK). FAC data is concerned
with structuring the data;

   * the SDC label. The SDC, Service Description Channel, contains - as the
name suggests - the description of the service, its name, how it is encoded, etc.
   * the AAC label. The service is encoded in the Main Service Channel, and
usually encoded as an AAC stream. 

For each of these labels it holds that "green"  means that processing is 
without errors.

The bottom line of the widget gives some quality indicators in a more
quantitative way. From left to right:

   * the quality of the FAC signal, expressed as number where higher is better;

   * the quality of the SDC signal, expressed as number, higher is better;

   * the quality of the AAC decoder, expressed as number, higher is better.

On the second to bottom line, we see the spectrum (3), the Mode (B),
the encoding of the MSC (QAM16) and the way the audio is encoded (AAC).

The remaining labels give an indication of the frequency and time offset
of the received signals. All labels are equipped with a tooltip telling
the function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the plugin.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The plugin is - as other plugins - developed under MSVC. Note that
the plugin uses an additional library (dll's):

   * libaad_drm-2.dll, for the decoding of the AAC data


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Work to be dome
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

As said, the plugin is experimental. What needs to be done is adding
the fdkaac decoder for newer audio encoding modes,
And - of course - remaining errors need to be detected and removed
